# AGENTS.md

This file contains guidelines and commands for agentic coding agents working in this repository.

# General guidelines

In all my interactions and plans be extremely concicse. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

For multi-step plans, divide them into multiple phases with different headings. That way I can describe whicih phases to implement at a time so we don't have to implement everything at once.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

### PHP/Laravel Commands

- **Run all tests**: `php artisan test` or `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
- **Run single test**: `php artisan test tests/feature/SpecificTest.php`
- **Run tests with coverage**: `php artisan test --coverage`
- **PHP static analysis**: `composer phpstan` or `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse`
- **PHP code formatting**: `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` (run before finalizing changes)
- **Start development server**: `composer dev` (runs server, queue, logs, reverb, vite)
- **Generate IDE helpers**: `php artisan ide-helper:generate && php artisan ide-helper:meta`

### Frontend Commands

- **Start Vite dev server**: `npm run dev`
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Lint and format frontend**: `npm run lint`
- **Run frontend tests**: `npm run test`
- **Frontend test coverage**: `npm run coverage`

## Code Style Guidelines

### PHP/Laravel Conventions

- **PHP Version**: 8.3+ with explicit return type declarations
- **Constructor Property Promotion**: Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion
- **Type Declarations**: Always use explicit return types and parameter type hints
- **Control Structures**: Always use curly braces, even for single-line blocks
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`)
- **Enums**: Use TitleCase for enum keys (e.g., `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`)

### Laravel-Specific Guidelines

- **Eloquent**: Use relationships and eager loading to prevent N+1 queries. Use PascalCase for variable naming
- **Validation**: Create Form Request classes for validation, not inline validation
- **Database**: Use Eloquent models and migrations, avoid `DB::` facade
- **Configuration**: Use `config()` helper, never `env()` outside config files
- **Testing**: Use factories for test models, prefer feature tests over unit tests
- **APIs**: Use Eloquent API Resources with versioning

### Frontend (Vue/TypeScript) Conventions

- **Framework**: Vue 3 with TypeScript. Use Inertia.js for routing unless routing is handled via advclient (game client). For building interactions within the game, components are loaded dynamically within the same page rather than using Inertia navigation. Use nuxt/ui for components. Vue 3 with destructured props syntax
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax
- **Code Formatting**: Prettier with single quotes, 2-space tabs, 80-char width
- **Linting**: ESLint with Vue and TypeScript configs
- **Components**: Check existing components before creating new ones
- **Component Location**: All Vue components and UI-related scripts MUST be placed in `resources/js/ui/` directory
- **Styling Approach**: Use Tailwind utility classes in template instead of custom CSS in `<style>` blocks. Avoid theme() functions and custom CSS - prefer utility classes directly in templates
- **Dark Mode**: Support dark mode using `dark:` prefixes when existing pages do

### File Structure Conventions

- **Laravel 10 Structure**: This project uses Laravel 10 structure (not migrated to Laravel 11)
- **Middleware**: `app/Http/Middleware/`
- **Service Providers**: `app/Providers/`
- **Exception Handling**: `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
- **Console Commands**: `app/Console/Kernel.php`

### Import/Export Guidelines

- **PHP**: Use PSR-4 autoloading, check existing files for import patterns
- **Frontend**: Use ES6 imports, follow existing component import patterns
- **Dependencies**: Do not change application dependencies without approval

### Error Handling

- **PHP**: Use proper exception handling, avoid suppressing errors
- **Frontend**: Use proper error boundaries and validation states
- **Logging**: Use Laravel's logging system, avoid direct error output

### Testing Requirements

- **Every change must be tested**: Write new tests or update existing ones
- **Test Types**: Prefer feature tests, use unit tests for isolated logic
- **Test Data**: Use factories with custom states when available
- **Coverage**: Run minimum tests needed for code quality and speed

### Code Quality Tools

- **PHPStan**: Level 8 static analysis with memory limit 2G
- **Laravel Pint**: Code formatting (run `--dirty` before committing)
- **ESLint**: Frontend linting with Vue and TypeScript rules
- **Prettier**: Frontend formatting with Tailwind plugin

### Documentation Guidelines

- **PHPDoc**: Use PHPDoc blocks over inline comments
- **Array Shapes**: Add useful array shape type definitions
- **Comments**: Only add comments for complex logic, prefer self-documenting code
- **Documentation Files**: Only create if explicitly requested

### Security Best Practices

- **Authentication**: Use Laravel's built-in auth and authorization features
- **Sanctum**: Use for API authentication
- **Validation**: Always validate user input
- **CSRF**: Use Laravel's CSRF protection
- **Environment**: Never commit secrets or use `env()` in code

### Performance Guidelines

- **Database**: Use eager loading, avoid N+1 queries
- **Frontend**: Use proper Vue reactivity patterns, avoid unnecessary re-renders
- **Assets**: Use Vite for optimized bundling
- **Caching**: Use Laravel's caching system appropriately

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes following existing conventions
2. Run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` for PHP formatting
3. Run `npm run lint` for frontend formatting
4. Run relevant tests to ensure functionality
5. Run `composer phpstan` for static analysis if any PHP files is changes
6. Run `npm run build` if any frontend changes are made
7. Test in browser if frontend changes were made

### Common Issues

- **Vite Manifest Error**: Run `npm run build` or `npm run dev`
- **Missing IDE Helpers**: Run `php artisan ide-helper:generate`
- **Test Failures**: Check database migrations and factory states
- **Style Issues**: Run Pint and Prettier to fix formatting

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.3.20
- inertiajs/inertia-laravel (INERTIA) - v2
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v11
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/reverb (REVERB) - v1
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- laravel/telescope (TELESCOPE) - v5
- larastan/larastan (LARASTAN) - v3
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v10
- @inertiajs/vue3 (INERTIA) - v2
- vue (VUE) - v3
- eslint (ESLINT) - v9
- laravel-echo (ECHO) - v2
- prettier (PRETTIER) - v3
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `inertia-vue-development` — Develops Inertia.js v2 Vue client-side applications. Activates when creating Vue pages, forms, or navigation; using &lt;Link&gt;, &lt;Form&gt;, useForm, or router; working with deferred props, prefetching, or polling; or when user mentions Vue with Inertia, Vue pages, Vue forms, or Vue navigation.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/Pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.

=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scrolling (merging props + `WhenVisible`), lazy loading on scroll, polling, prefetching.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v11 rules ===

# Laravel 11

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- This project upgraded from Laravel 10 without migrating to the new streamlined Laravel 11 file structure.
- This is perfectly fine and recommended by Laravel. Follow the existing structure from Laravel 10. We do not need to migrate to the Laravel 11 structure unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Laravel 10 Structure

- Middleware typically lives in `app/Http/Middleware/` and service providers in `app/Providers/`.
- There is no `bootstrap/app.php` application configuration in a Laravel 10 structure:
    - Middleware registration is in `app/Http/Kernel.php`
    - Exception handling is in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
    - Console commands and schedule registration is in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
    - Rate limits likely exist in `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

## New Artisan Commands

- List Artisan commands using Boost's MCP tool, if available. New commands available in Laravel 11:
    - `php artisan make:enum`
    - `php artisan make:class`
    - `php artisan make:interface`

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).

=== inertia-vue/core rules ===

# Inertia + Vue

Vue components must have a single root element.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.
