# Introductory comments
This a project I started on when first learning PHP and mysql. At the same time my JavaScript knowledge was basic. Bear this in mind while looking at the code as some modern features are missing. Back then I had little knowledge about PHP/JS frameworks and I also wanted to learn apart from any frameworks. This taught me a lot and also learned me to appreciate all the out-of-the-box solutions frameworks give you from the get-go. I have plans to migrate the project to existing frameworks. However with limited sparetime and other projects I want to work on the timeline is uncertain.
TODO list
- Migrate all of JS to typescript
- Migrate to Laravel
