Coding structure:

The structure is build on a version of Model-View-Controller (MVC) called Model-View-Presenter (MVP). There isn't used a specific framework to achieve this but 
rather a own designed framework.

When you go to a page in the adventurous domain you will be redirected to index.php site where the site will try and provide with the controller matching the site
you are trying to match. The controller then load the view associated with the controller. For updating the page AJAX calls are used. Different AJAX calls are sent
to different handlers which calls the provided models. The handlers are organized by their main purpose. For example GET request and POST request have different
handlers.

The program does not used static methods but rather try and stay true to dependency injection principle.
The game is hosted by domeneshop.no and FTP is used for publishing the code.
